PyBank
We are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of our company.  
We will use set of financial data called budget_data.csv which is comprised of two columns: 
Date and Profit/Loss

We will create Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "profit/losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Results will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file
